<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4"><b>Back2Back ministries is an organization that works with orphans all throughout the world. This is a nonprofit organization that originated in Monterrey, Mexico, but has since expanded to locations all around the world including Nigeria, Haiti, India, and two more locations in Mexico. 
One unique trait about Back2Back Ministries is that instead of going into an impoverished area and just giving money and resources to those in need, Back2Back focuses on investing in the lives of the families and the orphaned children in the area. They do this by building schools, hiring teachers, creating jobs, and giving children opportunities to attend college. 
<br>I have had experience with Back2Back ever since I was in the fifth grade when I went on my first trip to Monterrey, Mexico. When I was here I discovered my passion for working with children and serving in areas that are in need. Ever since this first trip, my family members have gone on many trips and I fundraise at home for this organization in order to try to help more people.
<br>The more I have worked with Back2Back, the more ideas I have come up with in order to help the program move forward. I am creating this website to spread awareness for this organization in hopes that more people may be able to invest their time and resources to a cause that is helping people in different parts of the world every single day.</b></font>
